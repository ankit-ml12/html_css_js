let diameter = 200000000;
//it is difficult to read so to put comma we use seprator

diameter = 200_000_000;
console.log(diameter); //200000000
//single at a time

//not allowed in string type

//BIGINT
//use n after number to convert it into bigInt
// or use
// BigInt
//all the operator work perfectlly for this Bigint.

//you can only do calculation between bigint and bigint not woth other type
// but we can do comparison between bigint and int

//when you divide bigint it remove the decimal part
