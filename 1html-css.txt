//html element and tags

Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.

Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets <>. For example, an opening paragraph tag looks like this: <p>.

Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: </p>.

<p>hello world</p>
element:- hello world
<p> :-tag


You can think of elements as containers for content. The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the element contains. The browser can then use that information to determine how it should interpret and format the content.

There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These elements often look like this: <br /> or <img/>, but some can also be used without the closing forward slash such as <br> or <img>. These are known as self-closing tags or empty elements because they don’t wrap any content


To let the computer know we want to create an HTML file, we need to append the filename with the .html extension as we have done when creating the index.html file.

It is worth noting that we named our HTML file index. We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our websites index.html. This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on our websites - and not having one will cause big problems.


The DOCTYPE
Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration. The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.

lang specifies the language of the text content in that element.
The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser. Inside the <head>, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.

The Charset Meta Element
We should always have the meta tag for the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element: <meta charset="utf-8">.

Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.

Title Element
Another element we should always include in the head of an HTML document is the title element:

<title>My First Webpage</title>

The title element is used to give webpages a human-readable title which is displayed in our webpage’s browser tab.

If we didn’t include a title element, the webpage’s title would default to its file name. In our case that would be index.html, which isn’t very meaningful for users; this would make it very difficult to find our webpage if the user has many browser tabs open.



Body Element
The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the <body> element. This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.
