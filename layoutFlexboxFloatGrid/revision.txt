layout:- content is arrange in some way 
building a layout means arranging content in web page in some specific way 
page layout and component layout

3way to build layout:- 
Float :- older 
Flexbox :- modern (better for one D component or row based component)
Css Grid :- complete 2d 


=================================================================
copy older code inside here to understand this propety


once we declare some class float then the content after it start floating around it.

/*  Floats */
.author-img {
  float: left;
  margin: 10px 10px;
}
.author {
  padding-left: 20px;
  padding-top: 10px;
  float: left;
}

h1 {
  float: left;
}
nav {
  float: right;
}

/* when all children of an parent are in float propety then it height is collapsed or become 0 */

text and inline element wrape around the float element 

to solve collapsing issue we use 
.clear{ 
  clear: both; 
  clear: left;
  clear: right;
  // first clear the empty div and then give clear class 
  //this is how we clear the float
}
we don't want to fill our html page with so we don't use this practice we use different tachniq.


we give class = clearfix
.clearfix::after {
  clear: both;
  content: "";
  display: block;
}
