javascript is a 

high level :- In low level developer has to manage resources manually. but in case of high level everything happen automatically .(pythone, js);
disadvantage of it program is not fast and efficient as low level language (c) 

garbage collected :- algoritham inside js which automatically remove the unused memory. we don't need to remove 

interpreted / just in time compiled :- convert machine code to compile
====================
multiparadigm:-

Paradigm :- 
1 procedural programming :-  just organising the code in very linear way with some function in between .
2. oops
3. functional programming


javascript does all of this 
====================
prototype based  :-first everything in js is object . we use allready build prototype ex arr.push() methode 
====================
first class function :- function are treated as just as regular variable , so we can pass function into another function and we can even return the function .

=====================
dynamic :- string to boolean, int, or anything

=====================

letter:- 

single threded 
non blocking even loop concurrency model 
:- we need this model because js is single threaded and we want to handel multiple task with the help of js
