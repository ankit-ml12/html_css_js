Js engile :- it execute js code 
ex:- V8 (powered node and google) 

Every js engile is consist of two thing one is heap and call stack. 
call stack where our code execute using executioin contest.
heap is unstructure memory pool where object are stored


===================how it work===========================
Compilation :- 

Source code  -----compilation --> Machine code ----- execution------>program running  

interpretation :- 
Source code --------------- line by line---------------------->program line

========================================================

JS is  interpretation based language but problem with interpretation based language is they are not efficient.
But modern js use both interpreter as well as compilation called just in time compiled.

=======================================================
What is javascript runtime :-
we can consider it as a big box containing all the things required to use javascript.
Heart of javascript runtime is js engine.
web api is also part of js runtime.
because runtime is like a box which contain all the js related stuff that we need, and web api and it also contain a callback queue.

queue:- contain all the callback function which are ready to execute.
webapi:- not part of js engine provided by brwoser attent to window object when js engine run.
